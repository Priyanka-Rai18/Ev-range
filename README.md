# Ev-range-Prediction
As a green and ecologically beneficial form of transportation, electric cars (EVs) are gaining popularity. One of the biggest challenges EV users have been being able to predict the amount of driving their vehicles can do on a single charge. Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular as a sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation One of the biggest challenges EV users have is predicting the amount of driving time their vehicles will have on one battery charge. Planning a trip and reducing range anxiety depends on an accurate range estimate. The goal of this study is to anticipate the EV driving range using machine learning methods. In this research, several regression models for predicting EV driving range will be developed and compared. A real-world dataset comprising various factors affecting EV range, such as power, trip distance, energy consumption, driving style, and environmental factors, is used for analysis. To manage missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, the dataset is preprocessed using exploratory data analysis methods. The findings of this study contribute to the expanding area of EV range prediction and provide EV buyers, producers, and regulators insightful information. The user experience can be improved, EV adoption can be boosted, and effective design of the charging infrastructure is made possible with accurate range prediction. The study also highlights the importance of model selection and data pretreatment in making accurate predictions.
